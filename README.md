## What is this about?

The Budget Key project aims at being the most up to date and comprehensive non-governmental database of Israeli fiscal data.

It has user-facing website (currently available at [obudget.org](http://obudget.org)), using multiple API servers which are running of maticulously collected data from various sources, manually improved and cleaned.

The data can also be queried using a relational query interface, available at [data.obudget.org](http://data.obudget.org) (use any Google account to log in after clicking 'Login with Google').
